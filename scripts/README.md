# RateEye Automation Scripts

This folder contains scripts to automate the development lifecycle of RateEye, specifically for releasing versions and initializing new milestones.

## Prerequisites

- **GitHub CLI (`gh`):** Must be installed and authenticated (`gh auth login`).
- **Git:** Must be configured locally.
- **uv:** Required for building the distribution package.
- **Python 3.x:** With `PyYAML` installed (`pip install PyYAML`).

## 1. Starting a New Milestone

The `start_milestone.py` script automates the creation of a GitHub Milestone, a dedicated feature branch, and all associated issues defined in `milestone_tasks.yaml`.

### Instructions:
1. **Update `milestone_tasks.yaml`:**
   - Set the `milestone` name.
   - Set the `branch` name.
   - Update the `description`.
   - List all `issues` with their respective `title` and `body`.
2. **Update `VERSION`:**
   - Update the root `VERSION` file to the target version for this milestone (e.g., `1.0.4_dev`).
3. **Run the script:**
   ```bash
   python scripts/start_milestone.py
   ```
4. **Action:** Follow the prompts to confirm the initialization.

## 2. Releasing a Version

The `release.py` script automates the final steps of a milestone: creating a Pull Request to `main`, merging it, cleaning up local branches, building the package, and creating a GitHub Release.

### Instructions:
1. **Ensure you are on your milestone branch.**
2. **Run the script:**
   ```bash
   python scripts/release.py --version v1.0.4
   ```
   *(Replace `v1.0.4` with your target release tag)*.
3. **Action:**
   - The script will show a "Plan of Action".
   - Confirm with `y` to execute.
   - It will automatically:
     - Create a PR from your current branch to `main`.
     - Merge the PR and delete the remote branch.
     - Switch your local environment to `main` and pull.
     - Build the project using `uv build`.
     - Create a GitHub Release with the build artifacts.
     - Prompt you to close the associated GitHub Milestone.
